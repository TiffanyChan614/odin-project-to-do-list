# Todo List

This is a simple todo list app inspired by The Odin Project - Todo list. I did this project to practice my skills in JavaScript that I learned from Web Scripting - Intro course in Fanshawe College. This project also allows me to explore more about DOM manipulation and how to use webpack to bundle my code.
